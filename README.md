# azure-csharp-todolist

This is my fourth project in my attempt to learn cloud skills.

This app takes the todo list from the Azure repo and adds a SQL Server to it. It makes it work locally as well as remotely (on Azure) and connects the DB.

## Quick Deploy Steps

I'll type these up soon.
